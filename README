MATE switch applet
==================

This is a MATE 1.7+ panel applet to toggle two shells commands.

I use it for my BEPO (Dvorak-like) practice:
Command1: setxkbmap fr oss
Command2: setxkbmap fr bepo

This is my first attempt at writing an applet (and using GTK). It is based on "command applet".
Don't hesitate to reports bugs, comments via GitHub.

TODO
====
- applet startup & dynamic orientation (change_orient)
- applet dynamic resize (change_size)
- gettext (internationalization)
